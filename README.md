# HAcKeR
I am currently learning python, so this is just a test project.
It is just a simple project which keeps on printing random numbers to your terminal, there by giving you a a hacker impression (since thats what we have seen in the films).
As i said earlier, this is just a test.
But still if someone finds this useful, i would fell happy (though i know, there isno use for such a bumb thing).
Still thnx for using.
